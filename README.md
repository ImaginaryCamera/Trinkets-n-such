# Vagabot
A bunch of hastily cobbled up button pushes and we have our very own flatlander to make do our bidding.

The manual does not work out the box but it can be made to work, 
a more dedicated solution will be made available but this really isn't hard stuff. Have a go at it :)

The autobot is more functional, extensions to it are planned so severe restructuring may soon be on the way, watch out!

Forgot to mention, there is some odd stuff with lists going on there,
for whatever reason I'm told I can't append np.arrays to make a chungus array, 
any clarification on what I must do for chungus array would be appreciated but for the mean time,
path_data is a list.
